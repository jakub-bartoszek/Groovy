Please be patient. I'm using free [onrender](https://render.com/) plan and it takes some time before the page fully loads.

## How does it work

This App fetches your Spotify data through [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), for example: Your saved tracks, Playlists, Followed Artists etc.
Groovy allows you to search for artists and songs. If you are Spotify Premium user, you can also play songs!
